# **AI-GUI-TTT**

This repository contains a **Tic-Tac-Toe game** where you can play against an **AI opponent**. The AI's intelligence is powered by a **machine learning model trained on optimal moves** determined by the **minimax algorithm**. The game is playable through both a simple **command-line interface (CLI)** and a **graphical user interface (GUI)** built with **Tkinter**.

---

## **Features**

- **AI Opponent**: Play against an AI that uses a **trained neural network** to make its moves.  
- **GUI and CLI**: Choose between a user-friendly **graphical interface** or a classic **terminal-based game**.  
- **Trained Model**: The AI uses a **pre-trained MLPClassifier** (`tic_tac_toe_model.joblib`) to predict the best move.  
- **Optimal Move Generation**: The training data was generated by exploring **all possible game states** and finding the **optimal move** for each using the **minimax algorithm**.

---

## **How It Works**

The core of the AI is a **machine learning model trained to play Tic-Tac-Toe perfectly**.

- **Data Generation (`script.py`)**: The training process starts by **generating all possible Tic-Tac-Toe board states**.
- **Optimal Move Calculation (`functions.py`)**: For each board state, the **minimax algorithm** is used to calculate the **optimal next move**. This creates a dataset mapping board states to the best possible moves.
- **Model Training (`script.py`)**: A **Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) classifier** from **scikit-learn** is trained on this dataset. The board state is the input (**features**), and the optimal move is the output (**target**). The final model is saved to **`tic_tac_toe_model.joblib`**.
- **Gameplay (`gui_game.py`, `play.py`)**: When playing the game, the current board state is fed into the **trained model**, which predicts the AI's next move.

## **Getting Started**

### **Prerequisites**

- **Python 3**
- **pip**

### **Installation**

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/cjeary-exe/ai-gui-ttt.git
   cd ai-gui-ttt
   ```

2. **Install the required Python packages**.  
   Tkinter is typically included with standard Python installations.

   ```bash
   pip install scikit-learn numpy joblib
   ```

## **How to Play**

You can choose to play using either the **graphical interface** or the **command-line version**.

### **GUI Version**

To play the game with the **graphical user interface**, run:

```bash
python gui_game.py
```

This will open a window where you can **click on the squares** to make your move.

### **Command-Line Version**

To play the game in your **terminal**, run:

```bash
python play.py
```

You will be prompted to **choose whether you want to be 'X' or 'O'** and to **enter your moves** as numbers from **0 to 8**.

## **File Overview**

- **`gui_game.py`**: Runs the Tic-Tac-Toe game with a **Tkinter-based graphical user interface**.  
- **`play.py`**: Runs the Tic-Tac-Toe game in the **command line**.  
- **`script.py`**: The script used to **generate game data**, **train the neural network** using the **minimax algorithm**, and **save the trained model**.  
- **`functions.py`**: A module containing **helper functions for game logic**, including **win/draw detection**, **board manipulation**, and the **minimax algorithm** itself.  
- **`tic_tac_toe_model.joblib`**: The **pre-trained MLPClassifier model file** used by the AI.  
- **`predictor.py`**: A simple utility script to **load the model** and **predict the best move** for a hardcoded board state.
